## Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to to my GitHub profile! 

Feel free to check out my repositories! âš¡

Please keep in mind that most of the projects featured on my GitHub are from my formative days as a developer, and represent my first foray into the tools/frameworks/languages used. 

They were primarily completed as part of a coding bootcamp that I have completed (General Assembly), and an introductory software engineering course (CS50). 

- ðŸ”­ I have completed the General Assembly Software Engineering Bootcamp.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently upskilling across multiple domains, including TypeScript, Java, and building more Python-based apps. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for any hybrid or remote opportunities in full-stack or front-end/back-end software development.
- ðŸ“« Reach me on my [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/bernadine-dao) or email!
- ðŸ‘€ Check out my portfolio website [here](https://berternie9.github.io/portfolio-website/).

Before I got into software engineering, I had been working as a doctor in Melbourne, Australia, for about 4 years. I then made the happy realisation that I loved the intellectual challenges of software engineering, and that coding tickled my brain in just the right way ... and the rest is history ðŸ˜„
