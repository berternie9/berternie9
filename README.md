## Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to to my GitHub profile! 

Feel free to check out my repositories! âš¡

Please keep in mind that most of the projects featured on my GitHub are from my formative days as a developer, and represent my first foray into the tools/frameworks/languages used. 

They were primarily completed as part of a coding bootcamp that I am attending (General Assembly), and an introductory software engineering course (CS50). 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently completing the General Assembly Software Engineering Bootcamp.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to build single page applications (SPAs) using modern tools and frameworks (i.e. React JS, AJAX)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for any hybrid or remote opportunities in full-stack and front-end software development.
- ðŸ“« Reach me on my [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/bernadine-dao) or email!
- ðŸ‘€ Check out my portfolio website [here](https://berternie9.github.io/portfolio-website/).

Before I got into software engineering, I had been working as a doctor in Melbourne, Australia, for about 4 years. I then made the happy realisation that I loved the intellectual challenges of software engineering, and that coding tickled my brain in just the right way ... and the rest is history ðŸ˜„
